# SkootApp
Android app for Skoot, a scooter rental system

## Instructions for deployment

You need to either run this on an emulator on the same machine the [server](https://github.com/lccatala/SkootServer) is running on, or change the value of ```backend_url``` in [strings.xml](https://github.com/lccatala/SkootApp/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) to that of your server.
